INTRODUCTION                            *vim-pnpm-intro*

When you are inside an npm project, you have a lot of 
tasks defined in your package.json. You often run them
inside a terminal or a separate window other than your
editor. This plugin creates standard commands to run 
your npm tasks using the Pnpm package manager for Node.js
